# Title
Evaluation of story-based math learning methods for individuals with math anxiety
: A randomized control trial of middle school students.

## Abstract 
“Math Anxiety” causes students to avoid STEM majors, delays graduation due to time and expense spent in and on “remedial hell” and contributes to the low percentage of students who graduate with a four-year degree within four years of starting college (one study revealed only 43% first-year students in 2015 received a four-year degree in 2019). It is estimated that 25% of college students experience moderate or high levels of anxiety. Equitable Learning proposes to leave behind the dreaded symbology-based math learning that induces anxiety and drives talented students away from STEAM subject areas.  We instead propose to meld visual, auditory and sensory learning experiences in math by appealing to the student through simple story-based learning exercises and language that is (nearly) free from jargon.
